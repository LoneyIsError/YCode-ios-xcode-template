# YCode-ios-xcode-template

## How to install

To install the template in your current Xcode installation, please follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Move the ```YCodeBaseTemplate``` folder in the repository into the ```~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Application/Project Templates``` directory. If it is the first time you install a template, the directories would be missing. A simple ```mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Application/Project\ Templates/``` in the command line would create the missing path.

## Please run ```pod install``` before you start a new project
